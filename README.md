#E-commerce_landing_page
This project demonstrates a responsive grid layout using modern CSS Grid techniques. The layout automatically adjusts based on the available screen size, making it suitable for various screen resolutions, from mobile devices to large desktops.

*Features*
1.Responsive Layout: Utilizes the CSS Grid auto-fit and minmax() properties to create a flexible, grid-based layout.
2.Dynamic Column Resizing: Automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the width of the container, ensuring a minimum width of 250px per column.
3.Supports All Screen Sizes: The grid expands and contracts dynamically, making it suitable for devices of all sizes.

How It Works
The project uses the following key CSS Grid properties:

*grid-template-columns*: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));: This sets the number of columns dynamically based on available space. The columns will have a minimum width of 250px and will expand to fill the remaining space equally.

*auto-fit*: Automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the container's width.

*minmax(250px, 1fr)*: Sets a minimum width of 250px and allows columns to grow to take up remaining space (using the 1fr unit).
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts based on screen size, providing an optimal viewing experience on different devices.
